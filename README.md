ProjectEuler
============

This repository contains my solutions to ProjectEuler.net problems. They are mainly done in java and I
will upload them as I get the chance. Many of them aren't focused on the "fastest" solution but rather the
first solution I could think of that works. I may return to some of these and re-upload solutions as "optimized" 
if I have time. Any questions or comments, feel free to email me!
