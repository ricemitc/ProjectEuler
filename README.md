ProjectEuler
============

This repository contains my solutions to ProjectEuler.net problems. They are mainly done in java and I
will upload them as I get the chance (I still need to find my code for several solutions). 
Many of them aren't focused on the "fastest" solution but rather the
first solution I could think of that works. I may return to some of these and re-upload solutions as "optimized" 
if I have time, and may begin doing some of them in C++ or Python for fun in a different repository. 
Any questions or comments, feel free to email me!
